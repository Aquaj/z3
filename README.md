This is Ruby interface for Z3.

It's in extremely early stages of development. Pull requests always welcome.

== Interface ==

Z3::Core is low level FFI interface, and it shouldn't be used directly.

Z3 is high level API, but it's extremely unstable at this point.

== Requirements ==

To use it, you'll need to install z3. On OSX that would be:

   brew install z3

On other systems use appropriate package manager.
